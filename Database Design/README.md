# Overview
For this module's assessment, select a topic of your choice and design a database in 3NF based on that topic.

You may start with one of the ungraded activities provided in this module, or you can choose a topic of personal or professional interest.

You must submit a report that includes the following:

1. A description of the database, including specifications on how the database will be used and a general description of the data that will be stored in the database. You may use descriptions from code-alongs design activities as a model.

2. A list of all entities and their attributes, including:

    1. The primary key of the entity
    2. The data type for each attribute, in generic or RDBMS-specific types
    3. Foreign keys
    4. Required attributes
3. An ERD that corresponds to the list of entities.

You may use any tool you wish to create the ERD, as long as it is complete and easy to read. If you choose to use paper and pencil, be sure that a photo or scan of the drawing is clear and reasonably sized.

Use the following checklist to evaluate the results:

- All entities and attributes follow the same naming convention.
- Each entity has an appropriate primary key.
- All relationships between tables are one-to-many relationships, using bridge entities where necessary for many-to-many relationships.
- Each entity is related to at least one other entity, with the foreign key on the appropriate side of the relationship.
- Each attribute is assigned an appropriate data type.
- Required attributes are easy to identify in both the list and the ERD.
- The design is in 3NF.
- The number of tables is reasonable for the planned database, with no unjustified tables.
